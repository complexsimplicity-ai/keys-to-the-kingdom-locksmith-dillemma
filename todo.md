- [ ] Create project directory structure (src, routes, controllers, services)
- [ ] Set up environment variables (.env) for API keys and configs
- [ ] Initialize Git and create .gitignore
- [ ] Write README.md with project overview

## Phase 2: MCP Server Core
- [ ] Install and configure MCP SDK
- [ ] Create MCP server initialization and connection handler
- [ ] Implement MCP tools/resources registry
- [ ] Set up MCP message routing and processing
- [ ] Add error handling and logging middleware
- [ ] Test basic MCP server connectivity
- [ ] Document MCP server architecture

## Phase 3: Text-to-Speech Integration
- [ ] Research and select TTS provider (OpenAI TTS, Google Cloud TTS, ElevenLabs, etc.)
- [ ] Set up TTS API credentials and authentication
- [ ] Create TTS service module with text input handling
- [ ] Implement audio format conversion (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- [ ] Add voice selection and customization options
- [ ] Implement streaming TTS for long text
- [ ] Create TTS caching mechanism for efficiency
- [ ] Test TTS with various text inputs

## Phase 4: REST API Development
- [ ] Set up Express.js server and middleware
- [ ] Design REST API endpoints structure
- [ ] Implement POST /api/tts/synthesize endpoint
- [ ] Implement GET /api/tts/voices endpoint (list available voices)
- [ ] Implement GET /api/jobs/search endpoint
- [ ] Implement GET /api/jobs/:id endpoint
- [ ] Add request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and security headers
- [ ] Add API authentication (JWT or API keys)
- [ ] Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

## Phase 5: Job Search Functionality
- [ ] Choose job search API/service (Indeed, LinkedIn, Adzuna, etc.)
- [ ] Set up job search API credentials
- [ ] Create job search service module
- [ ] Implement search filters (location, keywords, salary, remote)
- [ ] Add job data parsing and normalization
- [ ] Create job result caching mechanism
- [ ] Implement pagination for job results
- [ ] Add job details retrieval functionality
- [ ] Test job search with various queries

## Phase 6: Integration & Features
- [ ] Integrate TTS with job search results (read job descriptions)
- [ ] Create combined endpoint: search jobs and get audio summary
- [ ] Implement webhook support for async job processing
- [ ] Add job alerts/notifications functionality
- [ ] Create job bookmarking/favorites system
- [ ] Implement job application tracking
- [ ] Add analytics and usage tracking

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality
- [ ] Write unit tests for core services
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test MCP server communication
- [ ] Load test TTS and job search endpoints
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Perform security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Test with different TTS voices and languages

## Phase 8: Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Choose hosting platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, Railway, etc.)
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure database if needed (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Phase 9: Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide and examples
- [ ] Document MCP server usage
- [ ] Add code comments and JSDoc
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Write contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create demo video or GIF
- [ ] Publish to npm (if library) or Docker Hub

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add multi-language support for TTS
- [ ] Implement real-time job notifications via WebSocket
- [ ] Add AI-powered resume matching
- [ ] Create web dashboard UI
- [ ] Add more job board integrations
- [ ] Implement job application auto-fill
- [ ] Add interview preparation TTS features
- [ ] Create mobile app companion
